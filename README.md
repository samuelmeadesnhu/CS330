How do I approach designing software?

Understanding existing architecture requirements, business value, and user needs are all important factors to consider when approaching software design. Taking all of these into account, laying out clear documentation and visuals would be my next step, fleshing out design structure. 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

This project was broken up into milestones - similar to user stories. In the first few modules, we jumped right into the code, which didn't give a lot of time for design planning. If anything, this tought me to plan out the project structure instead of addressing stories too soon.

What design process did you follow for your project work?

Each milestone I tried to implement better design practices with the newly required features. Unfortunately, this was a lot to accomplish with the igven tasks for each week. My design process was messier than I would've liked, and the project would benefit from being broken down into more modular components. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

Traditional AGILE design approaches will be useful in future work to aid in team comprehension and collaboration. 

How do I approach developing programs?

I approach development by comprehending my program's needs, and researching existing applications/libraries that accomplish similar tasks. I then consider how to improve upon these solutions, whether it be from an architecture standpoint, development, or features. 

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

Because my knowledge of OpenGL was limited, I spent a lot fo time coding with tutorials running in the background. I found that when I would hit a road-block, the tutorials often addressed pieces I was struggling with. 

How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration was accomplished with the milestone setting. With each module, a new milestone was introduced, similar to how stories would populate a sprint in AGILE. 

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

My approach shifted a lot from beginning to end. Towards the end of the course, I realized that sacrificing output was not worth taking the time to better design the architecture in my app. To remedy this, I will partition more time for planning earlier in the project. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

I am a software developer, and my goals are to be a better software developer. Currently, computer science is the only thing that can help with me reaching that goal. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

I have a background in illustrating, and was always curious about 3D modeling and the software that went into it. Computational graphics gave me an insight into that world, and how object are rendered in multiple dimensions. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Learning new technologies is often a great way to lead yourself to new creative solutions as a developer. I believe the more well-rounded, the better the developer.
